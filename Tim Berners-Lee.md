A British scientist invented the [[World Wide Web]] in 1989 while working at CERN (European Council for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, Switzerland.

CERN is not an isolated laboratory, but rather the focal point for an extensive community that includes more than 17,000 scientists from over 100 countries.

Therefore Tim's early proposal was to let the researchers share the documents on their remote site, with and idea of [[HyperText]] that could have links from pages to pages.

By the middle 1980s, the Internet had a new, easy-to-use system for naming computers. This involved using the idea of the domain name. It made simple to reach the route and by a program called [[Domain Name Service]] maps domains onto [[IP Address]] hidden.
